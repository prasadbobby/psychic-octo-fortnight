What is a Variable?
A variable is a letter or symbol that represents an unknown number or a quantity that can change. Think of it as a container that can hold different values.

Why Use Variables?
Variables allow us to:
- Write general mathematical statements
- Solve problems with unknown quantities  
- Create formulas that work for many situations
- Express relationships between quantities"""

Visual Examples:
Imagine variables as empty boxes:
[x] + 3 = 7
The box [x] contains some number that makes this equation true.

Picture a balance scale:
Left side: x + 3
Right side: 7
The scale balances when x = 4

Diagram Exercise:
Draw boxes and fill them with different numbers to see how variables work in expressions like 2x + 5."""

Think About It:
Say this out loud: "x represents a mystery number"
Now say: "When I add 3 to my mystery number, I get 7"
What must the mystery number be?

Discussion Questions:
- How would you explain variables to a friend?
- Can you think of variables in everyday life?
- What's the difference between a variable and a regular number?

Listen and Learn:
Variables are like actors in a play - they can represent different characters (numbers) in different scenes (problems)."""

Detailed Explanation:
Variables serve as placeholders in mathematical expressions. The term "variable" comes from the word "vary," indicating that the value can change or vary depending on the context.

Key Points to Remember:
1. Variables are typically represented by letters (x, y, z, a, b, c)
2. The same variable in an expression represents the same value throughout
3. Different variables can represent different values
4. Variables can be replaced with actual numbers when their values are known

Written Practice:
Write three different expressions using the variable x. For each expression, explain in words what it means."""

        else:  # kinesthetic
            return base_content + """

Hands-On Activities:
1. Use physical objects (coins, blocks) to represent variables
2. Create a "variable box" - put different numbers in and see how expressions change
3. Act out word problems by walking through the steps

Interactive Exercise:
Step 1: Pick a number (this is your variable)
Step 2: Add 5 to it
Step 3: Multiply by 2
Step 4: Write this as an expression: 2(x + 5)

Real-World Connection:
Variables are like recipes - the ingredients (numbers) can change, but the process (expression) stays the same."""
